                  "What if you could use Nobel prize-winning science to predict the
                  choices your customers will make? Customer and user behaviors can
                  seem irrational. Shaped by mental shortcuts and psychological
                  biases, their actions often appear random on the surface. In Choice
                  Hacking, we'll learn to predict these irrational behaviors and apply
                  the science of decision-making to create unforgettable customer
                  experiences. Discover a framework for designing experiences that
                  doesn't just show you what principles to apply, but introduces a new
                  way of thinking about customer behavior. You'll finish Choice
                  Hacking feeling confident and ready to transform your experience
                  with science. In Choice Hacking, you'll discover: - How to make sure
                  your customer experience is designed for what people do (not what
                  they say they'll do) - How to increase the odds that customers will
                  make the \"right choice\" in any environment - How to design user
                  experiences that drive action and engagement - How to create retail
                  experiences that persuade and drive brand love - How brands like
                  Uber, Netflix, Disney, and Starbucks apply these principles in their
                  customer and user experiences Additional resources included with the
                  book: - Access to free video Companion Course - Access to exclusive
                  free resources, tools, examples, and use cases online Who will
                  benefit from reading Choice Hacking? This book was written for
                  anyone who wants to better understand customer and user
                  decision-making. Whether you're a consultant, strategist, digital
                  marketer, small business owner, writer, user experience designer,
                  student, manager, or organizational leader, you will find immediate
                  value in Choice Hacking. About the Author Jennifer Clinehens is
